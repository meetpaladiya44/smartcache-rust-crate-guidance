# Smart Cache Script

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Setup

The first step is to get the repository code that you have already submitted for the speedrun challenges. 

- **If you have not deleted that repo**: Open it in your Cursor or VSCode IDE
- **If you have deleted the repo**: Clone your published repository from your GitHub that you submitted for the speedrun challenges

### 2. Directory Navigation

After you have the code for that challenge open in your IDE, open the terminal and navigate to the appropriate directory:

#### For Counter Project:
```bash
cd speedrun_stylus/packages/stylus-demo
```

#### For NFT Project:
```bash
cd speedrun_stylus/packages/cargo-stylus/nft
```

#### For Vending Machine Project:
```bash
cd speedrun_stylus/packages/cargo-stylus/vending_machine
```

**Note**: In short, you have to find `rust-toolchain.toml` and `cd` into the folder structure until you get the `rust-toolchain.toml` file.

### 3. Install Dependencies and Add Cache Functionality

Install the stylus cache SDK:
```bash
cargo add stylus-cache-sdk
```

Then add the following code in your `lib.rs` file:

```rust
use stylus_cache_sdk::{is_contract_cacheable};

#[public]
impl Counter {
    pub fn is_cacheable(&self) -> bool {
        is_contract_cacheable()
    }
}
```

**Important**: Just like this example, in the `impl` block of your contract, you must include the `is_cacheable` function. Make sure that the function must be exactly like this.

### 4. Make Your Contract Unique

Change the name of any function in your contract to make it unique. For example, if you are working on the counter challenge, in the `impl Counter` block you will have all the defined functions. Change the function name like this:

- If the function name is `set_number`, change it to `set_number_meet`
- Simply append your name so that the contract can be unique for everyone

### 5. Deploy Your Contract

Run the following command in WSL only (if you are on Windows):

```bash
cargo stylus deploy --endpoint='https://sepolia-rollup.arbitrum.io/rpc' --private-key="<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>" --no-verify
```

**Troubleshooting**: If you get any issue related to `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, run the command:
```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Then run the `cargo stylus deploy` command again.

### 6. Commit and Submit

Commit your changes, push them to your repository, and make sure to submit that same repository again on [https://www.speedrunstylus.com/](https://www.speedrunstylus.com/) for the challenge you were working on (e.g., if the `lib.rs` was for counter contract, then submit your modified code for counter repo again in the speedrun).

### 7. Initialize Smart Cache

In that same challenge's code in your IDE, open a new terminal and run:

```bash
npm unlink -g smart-cache-cli
```

If you have installed smart-cache previously, then run:
```bash
npm install -g smart-cache-cli
```

Then run:
```bash
smart-cache init
```

This will create a new `smartcache.toml` file.

### 8. Configure Smart Cache

In the `smart-cache.toml` file, add:
- The contract address which you just deployed on Arbitrum Sepolia
- The deployed address of the private key which you used to deploy the contract on Arbitrum Sepolia

### 9. Add Contract to Cache

Run the command:
```bash
smart-cache add
```

This command will be running in your terminal and the contract will be cached to optimize gas usage.

### 10. Final Submission

Push your changed code to your GitHub repository again and then submit that repository again in the speedrun challenges.
